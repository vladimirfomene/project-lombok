# Removing Java Boilerplate Code with Project Lombok

**TL:DR:** An introduction to the article giving a brief summary of the what the article
will focus on.

## Prerequisites
Softwares you need to install to follow the tutorial:

* JDK 8 or above (find out which java version lombok supports).
* Any text editor or IDE of your choice, though I recommend Intellij.


## Why Use Project Lombok in your Java project
* Productivity through removal of boilerplate code.

## How Project Lombok's features work
* Explain how Project Lombok's functionalities work through annotations.

## Configuring your project with Project Lombok
* Add Project Lombok dependency to your project
* Add Project Lombok's plugin to your IDE.
* Configure your IDE for annotation processing.

## Project Lombok Features

### Accessor Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example (code the vanilla Java version, then
show how Project Lombok will help remove boilerplate code).
* Test the Project Lombok implementation against the vanilla Java implementation.

### Builder Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example (code the vanilla Java version, then
show how Project Lombok will help remove boilerplate code).
* Test the Project Lombok implementation against the vanilla Java implementation.

### Var Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example (code the vanilla Java version, then
show how Project Lombok will help remove boilerplate code).
* Test the Project Lombok implementation against the vanilla Java implementation.

### Cleanup Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example.
* Test the Project Lombok implementation against the vanilla Java implementation.

### Constructor Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.

### NonNull Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example (code the vanilla Java version, then
show how Project Lombok will help remove boilerplate code).
* Test the Project Lombok implementation against the vanilla Java implementation.

### ToString Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.

### Val Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example (code the vanilla Java version, then
show how Project Lombok will help remove boilerplate code).
* Test the Project Lombok implementation against the vanilla Java implementation.

### Value Annotation
* Explain how this annotation works and show its key options.
* Demonstrate with an example (code the vanilla Java version, then
show how Project Lombok will help remove boilerplate code).
